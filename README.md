# PONG-MEN - Revenge of the G'Host

This game is based on two big-hit retro games: Pong and Pac-Man. We added a twist to this game as we combined both Pac-Man and Pong into one. The ultimate pbjective of our game is to give the main antagonist of Pac-Man(the ghost) and give them a chance of redemption against Pac-Man by taking them both into a test of skill with Pong to decide the superior character. The two players have 3 hearts of health and each time you lose in a game of Pong, you lose one heart. The health system is the scoring system, and you are trying to keep your hearts. But this is not a traditional game of Pong, there are obstacles that will impede the way of the ball and make it bounce right back. Gameplay mechanics are very straightforward, WASD or arrow keys to move pac men, and WS or up and down arrow to move your pong paddle. To face off against your friend in Pong, you will first need to play some two-player Pac-Man, which is like traditional Pac-Man but when you both interact, it will send both of you to Pong. Good luck and have fun playing our totally original and innovative game. 

Limitations may include actual "predator and prey" that is in traditional Pac-Man and scoring. In Pong, sometimes the ball has a bounce pattern and is not actually completely random. This is because how the bounce mechanics we implemented are not advanced enough to make the ball truly bounce randomly.
